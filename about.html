                most visualizations give you an angle on the generic profile of the whisky such as here: <a  class="dark-hover"

                Other images show the location of distilleries. I wanted to join these two information sources and

            <p class=" centroid aboot">Scotland was traditionally divided into four regions: The Highlands,
                The Lowlands, The Isle of Islay, and Campbeltown. Due to the large number of distilleries found there,
                the Speyside region is now also recognized by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) as a distinct region.
                The whisky-producing islands other than Islay are not recognised as a distinct region by the SWA, which
                groups them into the Highlands region.

                The Lowlands: The southernmost region of Scotland.</br>
                There are five distilleries that remain in operation: Auchentoshan, Bladnoch, Glenkinchie, Annandale and
                Ailsa Bay from the Girvan Distillery plus three more—Daftmill, Eden Mill, and Kingsbarns—are currently
                pending their first releases.</br>
                Speyside: Speyside gets its name from the River Spey, which cuts through this region and provides water
                to many of the distilleries.</br>
                It has the largest number of distilleries, which includes: Aberlour, Balvenie, Cardhu, Cragganmore,
                Dalwhinnie, Glenfarclas, Glenglassaugh, Glenfiddich, Speyburn, The Macallan, The Glenlivet, and The
                Glenrothes.</br>
                Encompassing the area surrounding the River Spey in north-east Scotland, once considered part of the
                Highlands, has almost half of the total number (approx. 105 as of 2013) of distilleries in Scotland
                within its geographic boundaries; consequently it is officially recognized as a distinct region.
                The Highlands: The Highlands is by far the largest region in Scotland both in area and in whisky
                production.</br>
                Some Highland distilleries: Aberfeldy, Edradour, Balblair, Ben Nevis, Dalmore, Glen Ord, Glenmorangie,
                Oban, Glendronach, Old Pulteney, Tullibardine and Tomatin.</br>
                The Islands, an unrecognised sub-region includes all of the whisky-producing islands (but excludes
                Islay): Arran, Jura, Mull, Orkney, and Skye: with their respective distilleries: Arran, Jura, Tobermory,
                Highland Park and Scapa, and Talisker.</br>
                Campbeltown, once home to over 30 distilleries, currently has only three distilleries operating: Glen
                Scotia, Glengyle, and Springbank.</br>
                Islay /ˈaɪlə/: has eight producing distilleries: Ardbeg, Bowmore, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain, Caol Ila,
                Kilchoman, Lagavulin, and Laphroaig.</br>
                Although only five regions are specifically described, any Scottish locale may be used to describe a
                whisky if it is distilled entirely within that place; for example a single malt whisky distilled on
                Orkney could be described as Orkney Single Malt Scotch Whisky instead of as an Island whisky.</br></br>
